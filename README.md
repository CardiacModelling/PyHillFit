# dose-response-fitting
Code to load dose-response data and fit dose response curves in a Bayesian inference framework.

## Pre-requisites

The following packages are pre-requisites for running `dose-response-fitting`:
 * [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
 * [cma](https://www.lri.fr/~hansen/cmaes_inmatlab.html#python)
 * [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
 * [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
 * [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
 
On most linux distributions you can install these via [pip](), which itself can be installed, if it isn't already using a command like this (for debian/ubuntu):
```
sudo apt-get install python-pip
```
Then all the above dependencies can be installed in one go with:
```
sudo pip install numpy cma matplotlib scipy pandas
```

## Crumb dataset

We have made a .csv file of the [Crumb et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vascn.2016.03.009) dataset, which is available in the `data` folder, together with some example python scripts for reading it.

## Running the dose-response fitting code

To run the python-based dose-response fitting code, see the [README](python/README.md) in the `python` folder.

## Uncertainty Propagation

To run the Uncertainty Propagation example, see the [README](chaste/README.md) in the `chaste` folder.
