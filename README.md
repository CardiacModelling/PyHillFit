# dose-response-fitting
Code to load and fit dose response curves in a Bayesian inference framework

## Pre-requisites

The following packages are pre-requisites for running `dose-response-fitting`:
 * numpy

## Crumb dataset

We have made a .csv file of the [Crumb et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vascn.2016.03.009) dataset, which is available in the `data` folder, together with some example python scripts for reading it.

## Running the code

### Single-level dose-response fitting

### Hierarchical dose-response fitting

### Uncertainty Propagation

To run the Uncertainty Propagation example, see the [README](chaste/README.md) in the `chaste` folder.
