This is data from the paper:
Crumb et al. Journal of Pharmacological & Toxicological Methods (2016): An evaluation of 30 clinical drugs against the CiPA proposed ion channel panel

Raw data in Spreadsheet_of_data.xlsx (Excel)
converted to .csv

Analysed by running 'assemble_python_input_file.m' to create the file

../crumb_data.csv

which is a larger table of the format
['Drug','Channel','Experiment','Concentration','Inhibition']

It can be loaded, for instance, by using 'pandas' in the file 'Crumb_data_loading.py' (but we'll actually use a different script for the analysis later).
