# Running dose-response-fitting

You need to be inside the python directory (this directory) for this to work.

## Single-level and hierarchical MCMC

The MCMC script is
```
PyHillFit.py
```
which is called from the command line. For a list of additional command line arguments, run
```
python PyHillFit.py -h
```

You HAVE to specify an input data csv file, in the same format as the provided crumb_data.csv.
The default is to run the single-level MCMC algorithm.
To do this with the Crumb data, for example, run
```
python PyHillFit.py --data-file ../data/crumb_data.csv
```

Alternatively, include the --hierarchical argument:
```
python PyHillFit.py --data-file ../data/crumb_data.csv --hierarchical
```

After running the hierarchical MCMC, you should run:
```
python construct_hierarchical_cdfs.py
```
and select from the drug/channel menu, which will compute the posterior predictive distributions for pIC50_i and Hill_i.
After you have run ALL of these, you can plot a comparison of predicted dose-response curves:
```
python plot_all_predicted_curves.py -c 0.05 2
```
where "-c 0.05 2" means "plot predictions for % block at concentrations of 0.05 and 5 uM", you can do more or fewer than two, but the plots will get messy.  Again, you'll have to choose drug and channel from the list provided.

After only hierarchical (as in, you don't need non-hierarchical for this), you can plot superimposed marginal distributions and predicted dose-response curves using the mid-level parameters:
```
python plot_hierarchical_superimposed.py
```
and again select from the menu.

Everything will be saved in `python/output/...` plus a very verbose and hopefully-easy-to-follow chain of subdirectories.

# Input data files --data-file

Input data should be a csv file in the same format as data/crumb_data.csv, with one header line: "Compound,Channel,Experiment,Dose,Response".
Each data file can have as many compounds and channels as required.
